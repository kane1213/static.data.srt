surprised it got lost so things aren't

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479

30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,040
though i tried it all fell apart what it

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
meant to me will eventually be a memory

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,360
of a time when i tried so high

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,130
